# Compound Engineering

[![Build Status](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

AI skills that make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

> **CE-Orca fork:** this repository preserves EveryInc's native Compound Engineering workflows and adds an optional Orca execution overlay for Claude and Codex. The upstream project remains authoritative for skills and personas; fork-owned compatibility, provenance, and synchronization details live in [`integrations/orca/`](integrations/orca/README.md). Orca is not required for native execution.

## Philosophy

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier -- not harder.**

Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Every feature adds complexity. Every bug fix leaves behind a little more local knowledge that someone has to rediscover later. The codebase gets larger, the context gets harder to hold, and the next change becomes slower.

Compound engineering inverts this. 80% is in planning and review, 20% is in execution:

- Plan thoroughly before writing code with `/ce-brainstorm` and `/ce-plan` using one readiness-based plan artifact
- Review to catch issues and calibrate judgment with `/ce-code-review` and `/ce-doc-review`
- Codify knowledge so it is reusable with `/ce-compound`
- Keep quality high so future changes are easy

The point is not ceremony. The point is leverage. A good brainstorm makes the plan sharper. A good plan makes execution smaller. A good review catches the pattern, not just the bug. A good compound note means the next agent does not have to learn the same lesson from scratch.

## Workflow

The core loop is six steps: **brainstorm** the requirements, **plan** the implementation, **work** through the plan, **simplify** what you wrote, **review** the result, then **compound** the learning -- and repeat with better context.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`/ce-brainstorm`](docs/skills/ce-brainstorm.md) | Interactive Q&A to think through a feature or problem and write a requirements-only unified plan before planning |
| [`/ce-plan`](docs/skills/ce-plan.md) | Enrich feature ideas or requirements-only plans into implementation-ready plans |
| [`/ce-work`](docs/skills/ce-work.md) | Execute implementation-ready plans with worktrees and task tracking |
| [`/ce-simplify-code`](docs/skills/ce-simplify-code.md) | Refine the freshly written code for clarity and reuse before review |
| [`/ce-code-review`](docs/skills/ce-code-review.md) | Multi-agent review against the plan before merging |
| [`/ce-compound`](docs/skills/ce-compound.md) | Capture the learning into `docs/solutions/` so the next loop starts smarter |

Each cycle compounds: `/ce-compound` writes learnings that the next `/ce-brainstorm` and `/ce-plan` read as grounding -- brainstorms sharpen plans, plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented. That return arrow is the whole point.

### Additional skills

These sit around the loop or get reached for on demand -- not every cycle needs them.

| Skill | When to reach for it |
|-------|---------|
| [`/ce-ideate`](docs/skills/ce-ideate.md) | *Before the loop*, when you don't yet know what to build -- generates and critically ranks grounded ideas, then routes the strongest one into `/ce-brainstorm` |
| [`/ce-strategy`](docs/skills/ce-strategy.md) | *Upstream anchor* -- creates and maintains `STRATEGY.md`, read as grounding by ideate, brainstorm, and plan so strategy choices flow into every feature |
| [`/ce-product-pulse`](docs/skills/ce-product-pulse.md) | *Outer loop* -- a time-windowed report on what users actually experienced (usage, performance, errors), saved to `docs/pulse-reports/`; its follow-ups feed back into ideation and brainstorming |
| [`/ce-debug`](docs/skills/ce-debug.md) | *Instead of brainstorm -> plan -> work* when the input is a bug rather than a feature -- reproduce, trace root cause, fix, then polish/review before PR handoff when warranted |
| [`/ce-pov`](docs/skills/ce-pov.md) | *On demand, before you commit* -- a decisive, project-grounded verdict on whether to adopt, switch to, or revisit an external technology, library, pattern, or platform; works cold or mid-session, and proposes the next step (`/ce-plan`, `/ce-brainstorm`, or a spike) from the verdict |
| [`/ce-explain`](docs/skills/ce-explain.md) | *On demand, to keep learning* -- turns a concept, a diff, an idea, or "what did I do this week?" into a dense, visual explainer written for you personally, with an optional check-in (predict-then-reveal for diffs, corrected exercises) that makes it stick |

For the full catalog and how each skill chains together, see [docs/skills](docs/skills/README.md). The complete inventory is [below](#full-skill-inventory).

## Quick Example

**Finding a direction** -- when you don't have a specific idea yet, ideate first, then carry the strongest survivor into the loop:

```text
/ce-ideate new drawing tools
/ce-ideate surprise me
/ce-ideate github issues   # ground ideas in your open issues instead of a prompt
```

`/ce-ideate` does the homework first (codebase, past learnings, prior art on the web, optionally your issue tracker), then hands you a ranked set of grounded candidates to take into `/ce-brainstorm`.

**Standard feature loop** -- turn a rough idea into shipped, reviewed code:

```text
/ce-brainstorm make background job retries safer
/ce-plan
/ce-work
/ce-simplify-code
/ce-code-review
/ce-compound
```

**Simplifying code** -- use it after fresh implementation work, or point it at code that keeps slowing changes down:

```text
/ce-simplify-code
/ce-simplify-code simplify the code in my most-churned file
```

The first pass tightens recent branch changes before review. The targeted pass is useful when one file keeps absorbing unrelated fixes, follow-ups, or merge conflicts.

**Debugging a bug** -- when you start from broken behavior instead of a feature:

```text
/ce-debug the checkout webhook sometimes creates duplicate invoices
/ce-code-review
/ce-compound
```

**Autonomous** -- hand off a feature and let the agent run the whole pipeline:

```text
/ce-brainstorm describe the feature
/lfg
```

`/lfg` runs the loop hands-off: it plans, works through the plan, simplifies, runs code review and applies the fixes, runs browser tests, commits, pushes, opens a PR, then watches CI and repairs failures until it's green. Start it after `/ce-brainstorm` so it plans against real requirements rather than a one-line prompt. It's the autopilot version of the standard loop -- neat when you want to step away and come back to an open, green PR.

## Getting Started

After installing, run `/ce-setup` in any project. It checks repo-local config, reports optional tool capabilities, and helps keep machine-local CE settings safely gitignored.

The `compound-engineering` plugin currently ships 30 skills and 0 standalone agents. Specialist review, research, and workflow behavior lives inside the owning skills as skill-local prompt assets.

## CE-Orca runtime

The plugin and the orchestration runtime remain separate. Compound Engineering
owns the workflow semantics; the external `orca-orch` command launches and
waits for Orca runs, while orch-console can continue operating independently as
their local monitor. From an orch-console checkout, install the stable command
once and verify the versioned endpoint:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm orch:install-cli
orca-orch capabilities --protocol orca.local-protocol/v1
```

If the executable is not on `PATH`, set `CE_ORCA_COMMAND` to its executable
path. The value is passed directly to the process launcher, so it must not
contain shell arguments.

Each invocation accepts natural-language execution preferences. The controller
turns only explicit preferences into a schema-constrained, run-scoped patch;
ordinary product prose remains unchanged. For example:

```text
/lfg Use Claude Opus with high reasoning for planning, then 3 Codex gpt-5.6-sol workers at xhigh reasoning for implementation. Continue without confirmation.

/ce-doc-review Use Claude Opus with high reasoning for the security-lens reviewer; keep every other reviewer on the defaults.
```

You can also use the explicit JSON grammar in
[`integrations/orca/execution-request.schema.json`](integrations/orca/execution-request.schema.json).
Resolution precedence is built-ins <- `.ce-orca.json` project defaults <- named
private profile <- current prompt. Prompt overrides are never persisted. Saving
a profile requires an explicit `save-profile` action; confirmation is shown
only when the effective request has `confirmation: true`.

Without an override, every built-in CE role uses Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` with
medium reasoning. `parent` and `mid` roles have a 900-second supervision window;
`cheap` roles use 600 seconds. This `budget` controls elapsed supervision time,
not tokens or API spend.

| Requested runtime | `orca-orch` absent | Healthy and compatible | Installed but unhealthy/incompatible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) | Announced native CE | Orca for integrated stages | Preflight failure |
| `native` | Native CE | Native CE | Native CE |
| `orca` | Preflight failure | Orca for integrated stages | Preflight failure |

There is no mid-run fallback: once an Orca-owned stage starts, failures remain
visible and are not silently repeated by native agents. `/lfg` keeps one CE
controller for planning through shipping and propagates its stage targets to
the four child workflows as private, run-scoped data while preserving the
original user prompt. The resolved display labels target enforcement as
`orca`, `child-workflow`, or `native-unconfigurable`; explicit target overrides
for a native-unconfigurable stage fail before dispatch. Strict writing stages
also require an attested mutation
policy and exact file scope: Codex and Claude can write when their local CLI
passes preflight. Cursor remains catalogued for native CE routing, but is not
currently eligible for Orca-owned read or writer stages: Cursor Ask mode can
inherit MCP servers and plugins without per-invocation disable controls, so it
cannot attest `orca.read-policy/v1` or the writer policy.

See the [Orca integration guide](integrations/orca/README.md) for project and
profile examples, the immutable `resolve` -> `run --resolved` contract, exact
ownership boundaries, and upstream synchronization.

## Install

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add ethras/compound-engineering-orca
/plugin install compound-engineering
```

> **Already have Compound Engineering installed?** Compound Engineering moved to a root-native layout. You must refresh the marketplace *before* updating — see [Existing Installs](#existing-installs). Running `/plugin update` alone keeps you on the old version.

### Cursor

In Cursor Agent chat, install from the plugin marketplace:

```text
/add-plugin compound-engineering
```

Or search for "compound engineering" in the plugin marketplace.

### Codex App

Compound Engineering is not listed in Codex's built-in plugin marketplace yet. Add it as a custom marketplace:

1. In the Codex app, open **Plugins** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Add** / **Add plugin marketplace**.
3. Enter:

   | Field | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Source | `ethras/compound-engineering-orca` |
   | Git ref | `main` |
   | Sparse paths | leave blank |

4. Click **Add marketplace**.
5. Select **Compound Engineering**, install **compound-engineering**, then restart Codex.

The Codex app install is self-contained for Compound Engineering. Specialist reviewer and research behavior lives inside the skills as local prompt assets; no separate custom-agent install step is required.

### Codex CLI

Register the marketplace, then install the plugin.

1. **Register the marketplace with Codex:**

   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add ethras/compound-engineering-orca
   ```

2. **Install the plugin:**

   ```bash
   codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
   ```

   You can also launch `codex`, run `/plugins`, find the **Compound Engineering** marketplace, select the **compound-engineering** plugin, and choose **Install**. Restart Codex after install completes.

The native Codex plugin install is self-contained for Compound Engineering. Specialist reviewer and research behavior lives inside the skills as local prompt assets; no separate custom-agent install step is required.

For a non-default Codex profile, run every Codex-related step against the same `CODEX_HOME`. This example installs CE into a `work` profile:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex/profiles/work" codex plugin marketplace add ethras/compound-engineering-orca
CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex/profiles/work" codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

The marketplace step only makes the plugin available; the plugin install is what activates the native CE skills for that profile.

#### Codex inside Orca

Orca launches Codex with a managed `CODEX_HOME` under its application data
directory, but this is not a second plugin installation to maintain. On the
host, Orca links the managed home's `plugins`, `skills`, `prompts`, and other
Codex resources to the system home (`~/.codex`). It also mirrors
`~/.codex/config.toml` into the managed home before launch while preserving
Orca-owned hook and project-trust sections. The managed `.tmp/marketplaces/`
directory remains a separate disposable marketplace snapshot; it is not a
second plugin cache.

Install and maintain the plugin once. In the Codex app, use **Refresh** on the
workspace plugin. From a regular shell, refresh the system home explicitly:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex" codex plugin marketplace upgrade compound-engineering-plugin
CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex" codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

`plugin add` refreshes the installed copy from the upgraded marketplace
snapshot even when the plugin is already installed; ordinary updates do not
require `plugin remove`. Restart existing Codex sessions after refreshing so
they reload skill content. Removing and re-adding the marketplace is reserved
for a source migration, such as switching from the upstream EveryInc repository
to this fork.

Plugin synchronization does not extend to session data: worker transcripts
created under the managed home stay in its `sessions/` directory and are never
mirrored into `~/.codex`. The `ce-compound` session-history probe accounts for
this on its own — it scans the active `CODEX_HOME`, the conventional homes,
and Orca's managed sessions directory, and collapses duplicate routes to the
same physical directory — so Orca-launched worker sessions are discoverable
without any setup. Transcripts are read in place and stay local.

This behavior follows Orca's managed-home implementation in
[`codex-home-paths.ts`](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/blob/main/src/main/codex/codex-home-paths.ts),
[`codex-config-mirror.ts`](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/blob/main/src/main/codex/codex-config-mirror.ts),
and
[`runtime-home-service.ts`](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/blob/main/src/main/codex-accounts/runtime-home-service.ts).

#### Remove the legacy Codex tool map (pre-native installs)

If you previously installed Compound Engineering with the Bun `convert` / `install --to codex` CLI (before native Codex plugin support), that path may have inserted a managed block into your **global** Codex instructions file:

`<!-- BEGIN COMPOUND CODEX TOOL MAP -->` … `<!-- END COMPOUND CODEX TOOL MAP -->`

in `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` (default `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`). That Claude-compat tool map is obsolete — CE skills name Codex tools inline — and one of its lines incorrectly told Codex to collapse subagent dispatch onto the main thread. Native plugin install does **not** add this block.

Paste this into Codex (or any agent with access to your home directory) to remove it:

```text
Remove the obsolete Compound Engineering Codex tool-map block from my Codex home AGENTS.md.

1. Check `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` if CODEX_HOME is set, otherwise `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. If I use Codex profiles, also check `~/.codex/profiles/*/AGENTS.md`.
2. Look for the exact sentinels `<!-- BEGIN COMPOUND CODEX TOOL MAP -->` and `<!-- END COMPOUND CODEX TOOL MAP -->`.
3. If both are present, delete only the span from the BEGIN line through the END line (inclusive), leaving any other user content untouched. Do not edit project/repo AGENTS.md unless those exact sentinels are present there.
4. If the file is empty after the removal, delete the file.
5. Show a short before/after summary of what you changed (or say the block was already absent). Do not add a replacement tool map.
```

Re-running the Bun convert/install CLI for Codex also strips the block if it is still present; it no longer inserts it.

### Kimi Code CLI

Kimi Code CLI can install Compound Engineering directly from this repository because the repo ships a native `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json` manifest:

```text
/plugins install https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
```

You can also browse it through Kimi's custom marketplace flow:

```text
/plugins marketplace https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/main/.kimi-plugin/marketplace.json
```

After installing or updating, run `/reload` or start a new Kimi session so the plugin skills are loaded.

### Cline

Cline loads CE skills from on-demand `SKILL.md` directories. Enable **Settings -> Features -> Enable Skills** in the Cline extension, then link this repository's skills globally or per project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
./compound-engineering-plugin/.cline/scripts/install-skills.sh --global
```

Per-project install from a checkout:

```bash
./compound-engineering-plugin/.cline/scripts/install-skills.sh --project
```

Start a new Cline task after installing or updating skills. See [`.cline/INSTALL.md`](.cline/INSTALL.md) for pinning, local development, and uninstall steps.

### Grok Build CLI (`grok`)

xAI's [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) (`grok`) installs Compound Engineering directly from this repository — the repo root is a valid Grok plugin (`grok` reads the existing Claude-compatible manifests, and the repo also ships a native `.grok-plugin/plugin.json`):

```bash
grok plugin install EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
```

This tracks the repository; run `grok plugin update` to pull the latest. To browse it as a marketplace source instead, the repo ships a native `.grok-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```bash
grok plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
grok plugin install compound-engineering
```

Both paths track the repository directly (no commit pin), so no Bun install step is needed. Add `--trust` to skip the install confirmation. `grok` stores config under `~/.grok`; start a new session after installing so the skills load.

Compound Engineering is also being submitted to the official [xAI plugin marketplace](https://github.com/xai-org/plugin-marketplace); see [`docs/grok-marketplace-submission.md`](docs/grok-marketplace-submission.md) for the maintainer runbook.

### Devin CLI

Devin CLI can install Compound Engineering directly from GitHub because the repo ships a native `.devin-plugin/plugin.json` manifest:

```bash
devin plugins install EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
```

Verify the install and inspect the skills:

```bash
devin plugins list
devin plugins info compound-engineering
```

Update to the latest version with `devin plugins update compound-engineering`. Plugins load at session start, so start a new Devin session after installing or updating for the skills to appear (as `/compound-engineering:<skill>` slash commands).

A few skills declare Claude-style `allowed-tools` names that Devin does not map (for example `Bash`); those skills still work, but some of their actions ask for permission instead of running auto-approved. See [`docs/specs/devin.md`](docs/specs/devin.md) for details.

### GitHub Copilot

For **VS Code Copilot Agent Plugins**:

1. Run `Chat: Install Plugin from Source` from the VS Code command palette
2. Use `EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin` for the repo
3. Select `compound-engineering` when VS Code shows the plugins in this repository

For **Copilot CLI**, use:

Inside Copilot CLI:

```text
/plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

From a shell with the `copilot` binary:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
copilot plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

Copilot CLI reads the existing Claude-compatible plugin manifests, so no separate Bun install step is needed.

### Factory Droid

From a shell with the `droid` binary:

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
droid plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

Droid uses `plugin@marketplace` plugin IDs; here `compound-engineering` is the plugin and `compound-engineering-plugin` is the marketplace name. Droid installs the existing Claude Code-compatible plugin and translates the format automatically, so no Bun install step is needed.

### Qwen Code

```bash
qwen extensions install EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin:compound-engineering
```

Qwen Code installs Claude Code-compatible plugins directly from GitHub and converts the plugin format during install, so no Bun install step is needed.

### OpenCode

Add Compound Engineering to the `plugin` array in your global or project `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["compound-engineering@git+https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin.git"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after changing the config. The OpenCode plugin registers the Compound Engineering skills directory directly; no Bun installer or generated skill copy is required. See [`.opencode/INSTALL.md`](.opencode/INSTALL.md) for pinning examples.

### Pi

Install Compound Engineering as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
```

Required companion for CE workflows that dispatch reviewer, research, or implementation subagents:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents
```

Recommended companion for richer blocking questions:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-ask-user
```

### Antigravity CLI (`agy`)

Google has replaced the consumer Gemini CLI with [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google) (`agy`), which still runs on Gemini models. Install Compound Engineering directly from GitHub — no clone step required:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
```

Verify with `agy plugin list`. The repository root is the plugin package (`plugin.json` plus `skills/`).

For a local checkout or pinned release:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
agy plugin install ./compound-engineering-plugin
```

The bundled `.agy/` directory remains a compatibility entry point (`agy plugin install ./compound-engineering-plugin/.agy`). `agy` also loads `GEMINI.md` workspace context from the checkout.

See [`.agy/INSTALL.md`](.agy/INSTALL.md) for pinning, local development, uninstall, and legacy Gemini import.

### Existing Installs

Migrate an existing upstream `EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin` install by
removing its installed plugin and cached marketplace, then registering
`ethras/compound-engineering-orca`. Both repositories use the marketplace name
`compound-engineering-plugin`, so an in-place marketplace refresh does not
change the source repository.

**Claude Code**

```text
/plugin uninstall compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin marketplace remove compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin marketplace add ethras/compound-engineering-orca
/plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

**Codex CLI**

```bash
codex plugin remove compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
codex plugin marketplace remove compound-engineering-plugin
codex plugin marketplace add ethras/compound-engineering-orca
codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

If an uninstall/remove command reports that its target is already absent,
continue with the remaining migration steps. For a non-default Codex profile,
run all four Codex commands against the same `CODEX_HOME`.

**Codex App**

In **Plugins**, uninstall **compound-engineering**, remove the
`EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin` marketplace, then add a custom
marketplace with source `ethras/compound-engineering-orca`, Git ref `main`, and
no sparse paths. Reinstall **compound-engineering** and restart Codex.

If you configured a host with a direct path or sparse path under `plugins/compound-engineering`, edit or reinstall that source so it points at the repository root with no sparse path.

If a previous Bun-installed copy is still shadowing native plugin skills, run the current cleanup command from a checkout of this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethras/compound-engineering-orca.git /tmp/compound-engineering-orca-cleanup
cd /tmp/compound-engineering-orca-cleanup
bun install
bun run cleanup --target all
```

---

## Local Development

```bash
bun install
bun test
bun run release:validate
```

### From your local checkout

For active development, load this checkout directly in the harness you want to test.

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir "$PWD"
```

**Codex App**

In the app's **Add plugin marketplace** form, use this checkout as the source:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `/path/to/compound-engineering-plugin` |
| Git ref | current branch, or leave blank for a local folder |
| Sparse paths | leave blank |

**Codex CLI**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add "$PWD"
codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

Use a separate `CODEX_HOME` when you want to keep local testing isolated from your normal Codex profile. The Codex marketplace entry points at the public Git plugin source so root-shaped plugin repos install correctly; use a temporary marketplace catalog with a `source.url` plus `ref` when testing unpublished plugin-content changes end to end.

**Kimi Code CLI**

Inside Kimi Code CLI:

```text
/plugins install /path/to/compound-engineering-plugin
```

To test the local marketplace catalog instead, pass the catalog path:

```text
/plugins marketplace /path/to/compound-engineering-plugin/.kimi-plugin/marketplace.json
```

**Cline**

```bash
/path/to/compound-engineering-plugin/.cline/scripts/install-skills.sh --global
```

Enable **Settings -> Features -> Enable Skills** in the Cline extension, then start a new task.

**Devin CLI**

```bash
devin plugins install /path/to/compound-engineering-plugin
```

Local installs are linked to the checkout rather than copied, so skill edits apply on the next Devin session without reinstalling.

**OpenCode**

```json
{
  "plugin": ["/path/to/compound-engineering-plugin"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after changing `opencode.json`.

**Pi**

```bash
pi -e "$PWD"
```

**Antigravity CLI (`agy`)**

```bash
agy plugin install "$PWD"
agy plugin validate "$PWD"
```

Or install the bundled `.agy/` entry point:

```bash

## Limitations

OpenCode and Pi use native package/plugin loading from this repository. The Bun CLI remains for repository development and converter maintenance, not normal installation.

Release versions are owned by release automation. Routine feature PRs should not hand-bump plugin or marketplace manifest versions.

## FAQ

### Do I need Bun to install Compound Engineering?

No. Bun is only needed for repo development tasks and converter maintenance.

### Where do I see all available skills?

The skill inventory is in this README, and the deeper skill catalog is in [`docs/skills/README.md`](docs/skills/README.md). Each skill's authoritative runtime spec lives in `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`.

### Where is release history?

GitHub Releases are the canonical release-notes surface. The root [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) points to that history.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Issues, bug reports, and pull requests all help make this better, and we genuinely appreciate them — bug reports especially.

A note on what to expect: Compound Engineering is opinionated by design. It's maintained by [@kieranklaassen](https://github.com/kieranklaassen) and [@tmchow](https://github.com/tmchow), and its direction reflects a specific point of view about how AI-assisted engineering should work. So while we welcome help, we can't promise to accept every change — some proposals won't fit that vision even when they're good ideas on their own.

Open an issue or send a PR, and we'll fold in what moves the plugin in the right direction. We just want to be upfront that not everything will land.
