# Orca simplification review

Use this path only when `reviewer-analysis` is assigned to Orca.

The CE controller selects the unchanged diff/file scope, creates prompts from
the three installed persona assets, merges suggestions, edits code, verifies
behavior, and summarizes. Orca owns only the three read-only reviewer calls.
Do not launch native reviewers for an Orca-owned packet.

Create a private prompt directory outside the checkout. Write the full persona
prompt plus resolved scope as raw text to `reuse.txt`, `quality.txt`, and
`efficiency.txt`; do not hand-escape those prompt bytes inside JSON. Then build
and validate the fixed three-node packet deterministically:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the ce-simplify-code skill directory>";
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/orca-workflow.mjs" build-packet \
  --prompts-dir <private-prompt-directory> \
  --out <private-packet.json>
```

The builder accepts only stable regular prompt files, enforces the endpoint's
8 MiB aggregate confidential-packet limit, writes the packet through a private
atomic temporary file, and consumes the three raw prompt files on both success
and failure. Never retain those confidential staging files after the packet has
been built. If an infrastructure failure requires a full-roster rerun, create a
new private prompt directory and reconstruct all three prompts from the
unchanged resolved scope and the three canonical reviewer personas before
building a fresh packet.

Include exactly one node for each installed reviewer:
`code-reuse-reviewer`, `code-quality-reviewer`, and `efficiency-reviewer`.
All three are required and share wave 0. A configuration override changes a
target, not this fixed roster. Do not add executable command fields,
credentials, environment dumps, or mutation instructions; the prompt may keep
the native read-only inspection guidance. Submit through
`references/orca-routing.md`.

`orca-runtime.mjs run` returns a hydrated `ce-orca.dispatch/v1` envelope. Use
`result.value` as `ce-result.json`; for each completed node, retrieve its
hydrated artifact with `result.artifacts[artifactRef]` and feed `output` into
the native Step 3 merge. References such as `runs/<run-id>/...` are opaque
transport identifiers; never resolve or open them relative to the target
checkout or current working directory. The helper retrieves only published
artifacts through the protocol's allowlisted reader. If any reviewer fails,
the Orca run fails; keep completed artifacts and report the missing lens. Do
not construct a one-node retry packet: either stop with the incomplete pass or
rebuild a fresh packet containing all three required reviewers and rerun the
full fixed roster. Never combine artifacts from separate runs and claim a
complete three-lens pass. The CE controller alone applies and verifies changes.
